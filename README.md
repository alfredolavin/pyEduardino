# pyEduardino
A very simple "plugin" to add javascript like syntax to python. The project has my sons name and It was specifically developed to use python one-liners as a bash script substitute.

I included the package on pythonpy and it works great! I can do almost anything throw the console with it.

My motivation was very simple:
1) Python IS the perfect languaje
2) There of, all things most provide a Python interface
3) Bash does not have such interface 
4) We use pythonPy and pyEduardino to provide it.

I hope g\*d will forgive me for tainting the scred languaje with some javascript like bs. My humble addition is only to simplify onliners and some database programming.

The code was inspired from a stackoverflow answer
